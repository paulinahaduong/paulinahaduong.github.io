I primarily teach an Ashtanga-based vinyasa flow focused on creative sequencing and anatomical foundations as well as a restorative yoga flow designed for rest and relaxation. All poses are taught progressively, with appropriate modifications for injury and accessibility. I believe that yoga can be accessible to everyone and am committed to creating a welcoming environment for queer and trans people of color. As a PhD student in education at Harvard University, I bring a constructionist and trauma-informed lens to helping students develop body awareness and mindfulness. Read more about my philosophy [here](http://o2yoga.com/mid-june-teacher-feature-paulina-haduong/). Available for private, studio, and corporate classes; contact me at paulina (dot) haduong (at) gmail (dot) com for class inquiries.
