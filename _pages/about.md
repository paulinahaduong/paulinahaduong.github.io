I am a fourth-year doctoral student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in the Human Development, Learning and Teaching strand. As an educator, designer, and researcher, my interests lie at the intersection of computer science education, constructionism, and classroom communities. Rooted in the learning sciences, I look to understand and support K-12 teachers and students when they face challenges in learning computing together. I work with Dr. Karen Brennan and the [Creative Computing Lab](http://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/) and Dr. Danielle Allen and the [Democratic Knowledge Project](https://democraticknowledge.fas.harvard.edu). This fall, I can also be found co-teaching [T550: Designing for Learning by Creating](https://instagram.com/tfivefifty), and in spring 2020 I'll be teaching a new course called Online Learning Communities. Previously, I was a Fellow at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/). To get in touch, you can find me at haduong (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu.
