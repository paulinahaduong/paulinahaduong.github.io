			<h6>What is this?</h6>
            <p>Welcome to our giving circle, started by <a href="https://kassurbanmead.com/" target="_blank">Kass Urban-Mead</a> and <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Paulina Haduong</a>! We’re a group of friends and friends-of-friends and parents-of-friends and others scattered all over the country, united by our desire to make a difference in our local communities. We’re building solidarity, we’re building community, and we’re building power. We started this in the wake of the 2016 election, and collectively we have donated over $40,000 to 40+ organizations. For more about the history of giving circles, explore <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/03/226479/giving-circles-philanthropy" target="_blank">this link</a> or <a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/the-sweetness-of-circles/" target="_blank">this resource</a>.</p>

            <h6>How does it work?</h6>
            <p>Every month, we donate to a different organization. Your individual donation can be as small or as large as you like (we suggest a budget of $25/month), but we’ll pool our donations together to go to a specific organization. Every 6 months, we’ll ask for new submissions for organizations/take a vote. After the vote, we will email out the names of the organizations that were selected. Then, every month for the following six months you will receive an email prompting you to donate to the chosen organization, along with instructions on how to do so. (Usually Venmo is the preferred method.) Then the process starts up all over again!</p>

            <p>Usually the person who selected the organization collects the donations for it, but don’t let that deter you from participating. Another member of the group is always able to lead the collection. If it’s your month to collect money, make sure to email the listserv with the following after collecting money:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>2-3 sentences about why you love this org</li>
            <li>How much money we donated</li>
            <li>A receipt! (It’s a trusted circle, but just in case!)</li>
            </ul>
