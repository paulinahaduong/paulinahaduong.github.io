    <div class="citation">
    <p>Published in Proceedings of the 50th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '19), 2018</p>

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> K–12 introductory programming experiences are often highly scaffolded, and it can be challenging for teachers and learners to transition from these scaffolded experiences to experiences of learner-directed creative work, where learners are solving problems and fluently expressing ideas through code.</p>

    <p>Published in Information and Learning Sciences, 2019</p>

    <div class = "citation">
    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Some empirical evidence suggests that historically marginalized young people may enter introductory programming experiences with skepticism or reluctance, because of negative perceptions of the computing field. This paper aims to explore how learner identity and motivation can affect their experiences in an introductory computer science (CS) experience, particularly for young people who have some prior experience with computing.</p>

    <div class="citation">
    <p>Published in Computer Science Education, 2018</p>

    <p><b>Abstract:</b> The relationship between novices’ first programming language and their future achievement has drawn increasing interest owing to recent efforts to expand K–12 computing education.This article contributes to this topic by analyzing data from a retrospective study of more than 10,000 undergraduates enrolled in introductory computer science courses at 118 U.S. institutions of higher education.</p>
