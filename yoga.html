    <h4>yoga teaching</h4>

    <p>I am on the Ashtanga Faculty at <a href="https://www.downunderyoga.com" target="_blank">Down Under</a>, teaching Mysore in the South End and Ashtanga Flow at Harvard and the South End. All poses are taught progressively, with appropriate modifications for injury and accessibility. I believe that yoga can be accessible to every body and am committed to creating a welcoming environment for queer and trans people of color. As a PhD student in education at Harvard University, I bring a constructionist and trauma-informed lens to helping students develop body awareness and mindfulness. 

    In addition to teaching ashtanga, I also teach mobility-focused classes at the <a href="https://www.thecornerstudioyoga.com" target="_blank">Corner Studio</a> and the <a href="https://www.bostonboulderingproject.com/yoga-fitness" target="_blank">Boston Bouldering Project</a>. Available for private, studio, and corporate classes; contact me at paulina (dot) haduong (at) gmail (dot) com for class inquiries.</p>

    <h5>current (public) teaching schedule</h5>
    
<!--     <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, my teaching has moved to Zoom! <a href="https://yogawithfriends.substack.com/" target="_blank">Check out my updated schedule for donation-based online classes.</a> Previously, I could be found assisting in the Mysore room at Down Under Yoga, teaching restorative yoga with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response at Harvard University, and teaching vinyasa classes at Samara Yoga and O2 Yoga.</p> -->
        

<!-- In addition to regular classes, you can also find me subbing all over Boston, mostly at Healthworks or YogaWorks. -->
